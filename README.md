  ## Description:
  I was bad at creating a professional README and wanted something to help me create one.
  I built this project to help me create a professional README in a relatively short amount of time since I am making two READMEs a week.
  I can now make a professional README for any project I make.
  I learned how to use switch cases, use inquirer and the terminal to design a backend app.
  

  ## Installation:
  Download the project on Github and download node modules from inquirer

  ## Usage:
  cd the path where the project sits in your computer using the terminal and then "node index" to run the app in the terminal

  ## Contribution:
  They can add more features
  
  ## Testing:
  I run the project in the terminal
